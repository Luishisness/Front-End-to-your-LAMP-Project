I only have one link to provide for my final project because I only used one html page. 
My main html page contains two different query sections "Please select Pokemon Year" and 
"Please Select Pokemon PSA pricing criteria." When you use the "Please Select Pokemon PSA 
pricing criteria" query,  you will be directed to the php page containing the query data. 
From the PHP page, you have the option to sort the PSA cards by Pokemon illustrator (This form was created using php). 
Below is the link to my main project page.

HTML/xHTML/CSS and PHP: the “Front End” of your on-line database LAMP project
This is the second of two assignments which comprise your LAMP project: You created and populated data tables in MySQL in Assignment #5 … and you are now asked to construct the front-end – (your user interface) – in this assignment, #7.

Description
Set up an on-line database application front-end using HTML/xHTML,CSS and PHP to use the tables you have created and populated in MySQL in Assignment #5. Your application should include a minimum of:

an opening page to introduce the project
a “menu” screen (which can be the same as your opening page if you wish)
Reports: Two or more reports based on data in your database as follows:
both reports should run against a minimum of 2 tables
at least one report should include hyperlinks
at least one report should include images
at least one report opening webpage should offer the user a drop-down box allowing the user to determine the field(s) to use for sorting the data in the report
at least one report should include a drop-down user selection on the form that is created using PHP to cull data from a table in your MySQL database; this selection will be used to select data for the report.
Your reports should indicate to the user if no records meet the criteria (in other words, if the result set and hence the report is empty).
User interface: Use CSS where possible for a consistent “look and feel” to your application
